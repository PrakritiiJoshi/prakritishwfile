<h3>Why are cafes the best place to study?</h3>
<p>Coffee allows you to stay caffinated and energized to do your work.</p>

<p>Great background noise. Whether it's people talking or chill music, the noise in cafes allows you to drain out your random thoughts and focus on your work.</p>

<p>FREE WiFi-Who can live without WiFi?</p>

<p>Food. You need constant energy to do work and having food you can get near you is extremely beneficial!</p>

<p>You can talk to people. Unlike the library you can talk to people and it's a great place to meet for group projects!</p>
